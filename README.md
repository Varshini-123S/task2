# task2
This project is a simple front-end To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them, offering an easy and interactive way to manage daily activities.
The interface is designed using CSS to provide a clean and responsive layout, while JavaScript handles all dynamic functionalities such as task creation, updating, and removal.
Since this is a front-end-only application, it runs directly in the browser without requiring any backend or server setup.
To execute the project, download the files, ensure that the HTML file is linked to the CSS and JavaScript files, and simply open the index.html file in any web browser.
This project is ideal for beginners learning DOM manipulation and basic web development concepts.
